        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The source code is translated into machine code once, which is specific to the target. Whereas in interpreted languages source code is interpreted and translated each time the programme runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. It is a technique to manage errors during executiona and prevent crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The finally block will always be executed, no matter if the try block raises an error or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Logging in Python is a way to record information about your Python scripts and keep track of events generated by the scripts as they take place.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The difference between 'import' and 'from import' is that using 'import' you import the whole module. 'from import' you import a part of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Python allows you to catch multiple exceptions in a single try-except block by using a tuple of exception types. For example: except (TypeError, ValueError)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Multiprocessing uses multiple CPUs to run many processes at a time while multithreading creates multiple threads within a single process to get faster and more efficient task execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Logging is essential to understand the behaviour of the application and to debug unexpected issues or for simply tracking events.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and freeing memory for a program to run efficiently\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, the basic steps for exception handling involve using a \"try...except\" block, where you place the code that might raise an error within the \"try\" block, and then use the \"except\" block to catch and handle any exceptions that occur within the \"try\" block\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Memory management in Python is important because it ensures that programs run efficiently and have enough memory to store their data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The garbage collector in Python locates and releases memory occupied by objects that can no longer be accessed or referenced by the program's code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The difference between the os.fork and multiprocessing.Process is portability and library overhead, since os.fork is not supported in windows, and the multiprocessing framework is included to make multiprocessing.Process work.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Read method reads the whole file as a single string while readlines segregates each of the line in the file and you then can later on call them line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Python logging module allows you to track events that occur while your program is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The primary challenge with memory management in Python is the potential for memory leaks due to its automatic garbage collection system\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. By using raise statement you can raise exception manually in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In some applications it is easier to code different remote procedure calls and conversations in separate threads than to manage them from the same thread."
